# XMeme
XMeme is a simple backend web application where users can post and see memes.

During the course of this project,
- Built XMeme by writing necessary GET and POST APIs for fetching and posting the memes.
- Built the backend application from scratch using a spring starter template and stored/retrieved the data from MongoDB.
- Tested the application functionality.
